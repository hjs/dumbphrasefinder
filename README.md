# Dumb Phrase Finder

Based on the awesome [gmailjs](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js/) library and [this](https://github.com/josteink/gmailjs-node-boilerplate) boilerplate.

Only works in Chrome and Gmail for now. (I wrote this hungover on New Year's Day, so definitely not super well tested...)

## Installation

```
# clone the repo (duh)
git clone https://github.com/hjs/circleback/

# get deps and build
cd circleback
npm install
npm run build
```

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and check the box for `Developer mode` in the top right.
2. Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the folder containing the extension (`manifest.json`) to install it.
3. Go to `mail.google.com` in your browser.
